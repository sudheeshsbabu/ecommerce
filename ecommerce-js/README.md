# E-commerce Project (React + Vite)

This project is a modern e-commerce application built with React and Vite. It serves as a study project to learn and implement core e-commerce features using a component-based architecture.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a fully functional e-commerce interface, potentially migrating from or referenced by the static files found in the `starting-code` directory. It focuses on:
-   Component-based UI development.
-   State management for cart and products.
-   Modern tooling with Vite.

## Tech Stack

-   **Framework**: React 19
-   **Build Tool**: Vite
-   **Language**: JavaScript (ES Modules)
-   **Linting**: ESLint

## Project Structure

*   **`src/`**: Contains the main React application source code.
*   **`starting-code/`**: Reference static HTML/CSS files (likely the original design or prototype).
*   **`public/`**: Static assets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ecommerce
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running Development Server

To start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will spin up a server (usually at `http://localhost:5173`) where you can view the application.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates optimized static files in the `dist/` folder.
